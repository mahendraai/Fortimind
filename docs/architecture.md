# Architecture Overview of RustGuard EDR

## Introduction
RustGuard EDR is an endpoint detection and response solution designed to monitor and protect systems from various threats. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy integration of components and scalability.

## Components

### 1. EDR Agent
The core of the RustGuard EDR is the agent, implemented in Rust. It is responsible for monitoring system activities, including processes, files, and network traffic. The agent consists of several key modules:

- **Process Monitoring**: Tracks and analyzes running processes to detect suspicious activities.
- **File Monitoring**: Observes file changes and access patterns to identify potential threats.
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitors network connections and data transfers for unusual behavior.

### 2. Sandboxing
To enhance security, the agent includes sandboxing capabilities:

- **Linux Sandboxing**: Provides a controlled environment for monitored processes on Linux systems.
- **Windows Sandboxing**: Similar functionality for Windows, ensuring that processes operate within defined limits.

### 3. AI Inference
The agent leverages AI for threat detection:

- **Model Inference**: Utilizes ONNX models to analyze data and make predictions about potential threats.

### 4. Telemetry
The telemetry module collects and streams data from the agent for further analysis. This data is crucial for understanding system behavior and identifying anomalies.

### 5. Configuration Management
The configuration module handles loading and managing settings for the agent, allowing for flexible deployment in various environments.

### 6. Utility Functions
Helper utilities support the main functionalities of the agent, providing common functions used across different modules.

## AI Server
An optional external AI engine is implemented in Python using FastAPI. This server handles:

- **Model Management**: Stores and serves machine learning and deep learning models.
- **Inference Logic**: Processes requests for model inference and returns predictions.

## Dashboard
The admin UI dashboard is built using React or Tauri, providing a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing the EDR system. Key features include:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Displays live data from the agent.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Notifies users of potential threats and system anomalies.

## Backend API
The backend API, implemented in Rust or FastAPI, serves as the communication layer between the agent, AI server, and dashboard. It handles:

- **Routing**: Defines endpoints for various functionalities.
- **Authentication**: Manages user access and permissions.
- **Database Management**: Interacts with the database to store and retrieve data.

## Conclusion
The architecture of RustGuard EDR is designed for flexibility, scalability, and security. Each component plays a vital role in providing comprehensive endpoint protection, making it a robust solution for modern cybersecurity challenges.
