# Threat Detection Capabilities of RustGuard EDR

## Overview
RustGuard EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) is designed to provide robust threat detection capabilities to safeguard systems against various types of cyber threats. This document outlines the key features and methodologies employed in the threat detection process.

## Key Features

### 1. Process Monitoring
The agent continuously monitors running processes on the system. It tracks process creation, termination, and resource usage. Anomalies in process behavior, such as unexpected CPU or memory spikes, can trigger alerts for further investigation.

### 2. File Integrity Monitoring
RustGuard EDR implements file monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to critical files. It logs file access patterns and modifications, allowing for the identification of potential data breaches or malicious activities.

### 3. Network Traffic Analysis
The network monitoring component analyzes outgoing and incoming network traffic. It identifies unusual patterns, such as connections to known malicious IP addresses or unexpected data exfiltration attempts, enabling proactive threat detection.

### 4. AI-Powered Threat Detection
Leveraging AI and machine learning models, RustGuard EDR can analyze telemetry data to identify potential threats. The system utilizes pre-trained ONNX models for malware classification and anomaly detection, enhancing its ability to detect sophisticated threats.

### 5. Sandbox Environment
To safely analyze suspicious processes, RustGuard EDR employs sandboxing techniques. This allows the agent to execute and monitor potentially harmful applications in a controlled environment, preventing them from affecting the host system.

## Detection Methodologies

### Signature-Based Detection
This traditional method relies on known signatures of malware and other threats. The agent compares running processes and files against a database of known threats to identify potential risks.

### Anomaly-Based Detection
RustGuard EDR employs anomaly detection techniques to identify deviations from normal behavior. By establishing a baseline of typical system activity, the agent can flag unusual behavior that may indicate a security incident.

### Heuristic Analysis
The agent uses heuristic analysis to evaluate the behavior of applications and processes. This method helps in identifying new or unknown threats based on their behavior rather than relying solely on known signatures.

## Conclusion
RustGuard EDR's comprehensive threat detection capabilities combine traditional methods with advanced AI techniques to provide a robust defense against cyber threats. Continuous monitoring, coupled with intelligent analysis, ensures that organizations can respond swiftly to potential security incidents.
